# What is Shiny?

- Rstudio package authored by Joe Cheng

--

- Web development framework for R

--

- Can be used to build interactive web pages with R

---

# Why is Shiny amazing?

--

- No knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript required

--

- Can share R analysis with any audience type.

--

- So many bells and whistles you can add to applications

# Let's get started: Install shiny!



```r
# install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```



# See how your code works: Run it in showcase mode

- runApp('Code/Exercises/add_title_03.R', display.mode = "showcase")

- runExample("01_hello")

- code is highlighted in server as it is run

---


# Shiny App Basics: Part 1

- Every Shiny App is made up of two parts

--

- UI: a web page that shows the app to the user. UI is HTML using Shiny’s functions and is where the layout of hte app is defined (how the app looks). 

- Server: a computer that powers the app that has the logic of the functionality. 

---

# Shiny App Basics: Part 2

## Shiny Template 


```r
library(shiny)
ui &lt;- fluidPage()
server &lt;- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 1

--

### Create a standalone app.R 
--

- All your code is in one place

--

- your file must be named app.R for Rstudio to recognize it as a shiny app.

--

- Your turn: Run app01.R


???

Run app01.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 2

--

### Create a ui.R and server.R 
--

- This is great for more complex applications

--

- our examples today will primarily be app.R files to make the concepts easy to follow.

--

- Your turn: Open folder App_02 and run either the ui or server file.

???

Run app02.R

---

# Running a Shiny app: Method 3

--

### In Rstudio &gt;&gt; File &gt;&gt; Shiny Web App
--

- this will automatically set up the template for you.

--

- you can customize it like app


---

#Exercise 01

## Let's a run real app: Go to Exercises and Run add_title_03.R

???
Pause 1 minute
---

## Your turn: Add a title to this app reference code in add_title_03.R

???

Pause 1 minute

---
# Shiny App Contents

--
- UI: Layout and app appearance


```r
ui &lt;- fluidePage() 
```
--
- Server: instructions to build the app

```r
server &lt;- function(input, output){} 

shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server)
```

---

## Now let's build a real app using college grad student data (fivethirtyeight package) 

--

- Two requirements: 

- Axis Inputs: users can enter what they want to plot.

- Plot: return the plot based on the axis inputs selected.


---
# App Basics

- Step 1:load the data from five thirty eight

```r
library(shiny)
library(fivethirtyeight)
ui &lt;- fluidPage()
server &lt;- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


---
background-image: url("https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7bb57OiYdtIk6xG/giphy.gif")
class: center, inverse

---

# Remember the ui portion of the app 


```r
library(shiny)
library(fivethirtyeight)
ui &lt;- fluidPage()
server &lt;- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


---
# UI Basics: Part 1

## Inputs and Outputs

- fluidPage - sets up basic visual structure of a page.

- selectInput(others like it): allow users to interact and provide a value

- verbatimTextOutput() and tableOutput() are output controls that tell Shiny where to put the output.


---

# UI Basics: Part 2

- UI simply creates HTML (Shiny allows you to create UI without having to know HTML)


```r
sliderInput("num", "Choose a number",
            min = 0, max = 500, value = 10)
```

HTML code

```r
&lt;div class="form-group shiny-input-container"&gt;
  &lt;label class="control-label" for="num"&gt;Choose a number&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input class="js-range-slider" id="num" data-min="0" data-max="500" data-from="10" data-step="1" data-grid="true" data-grid-num="10" data-grid-snap="false" data-prettify-separator="," data-keyboard="true" data-keyboard-step="1" data-drag-interval="true" data-data-type="number"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
```

---

# UI Basics: Part 3

--

- HTML tags can be found at http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html

--

- Simple ones: h1() = header1, br() = line break, strong() = bold text

--

- You can access HTML tag using `tags` object

--

- h2 = tags$h2(), br = tags$br()

--

- Don't have to use `tags` for common objects


---

#UI with HTML example: Run ui_html_05.R

```r
library(shiny)
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
	h1("Shiny App Title"),
	h4("This is awesome"),
	"Hello",
"Shiny workshop",
br(),
strong("bold text")
)
server &lt;- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
???

- Pause 1 minute
- in the demo_examples folder

---
# UI with Layouts

- Typically all items stack up after the other.

--

- Layouts: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html

--

- advanced layouts: fluidRow and column to build your layout up from a grid system or navbarpage

---

# We’ll use sidebarLayout(): Run Basics_ui_04.R and basics_ui_right_04.R

---

```r
library(shiny)
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),

  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
)
server &lt;- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
???

- fluidpage creates a page that dynamically adapts to the size of your window

- look at basics_ui_right_04.R for examples

- this is also in the demo_examples folder


---

# You can also use tags within *Panel command: UI with Layout and HTML

### Open and run tags_html_06.R

---

# UI: Widgets

- shiny also has built in widgets 

.pull-center[
![](img/shiny_widgets.png)]

---

# UI: Widgets

- you can add widgets in your sidebarPanel or mainPanel of the app

- All widgets have the first two arguments in common:

    1. name for the widget so you can access the widget and trigger actions or effects.
    2. label: the name of the widget in your app. 
    
- learn more about widgets: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/

---

# Let's go back to the app we were trying to build with college grad data


.pull-center[
![](img/college_grad_ui.png)]


---

# Session

- A session is the state of one live instance of a running shiny app

- begins when app is loaded in a browser 

- each session needs to be independent to avoid overlapping actions

- the server function is called once for each session (private scope) so every variable inside the server function is only available to that function.
---

# Server 

- Three components:input, output, session

- session begins when shiny app runs

- input:  list-like object that has all the input data from the user interaction with the browser


```r
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)
```
---
# Server
- input objects are read only from the browser(ultimate source of info). So this will return an error:


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
  input$length &lt;- 85 
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
# Error: Attempted to assign value to a read-only reactivevalues object
```
- can only be read in a reactive context like renderPlot() or reactive()

---

# Server : Render function

- Outputs are reactive: Shiny recalculates them as the user interacts and changes them.

- there is a **render** function designed for each type of output: renderPrint, renderTable, renderPlot, etc. 

.pull-center[
![](img/shiny_render.png)]

---

# Server: Render Function (cont'd)

- render functions do two things:

  1.  reactive contexts that tracks inputs for outputs uses 

  2.  converts R code to HTML to display


---
# Server
- output: list-like object named after the output ID. This is to send info back to the browser


```r
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  textOutput("message")
)

server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
  output$message &lt;- renderText({
    "Hello shiny course!"
  })
}
```
---
# Introducing Reactivity

- Shiny uses reactivity to make apps interactive (Stay tuned.)

--

- In reactivity, you are telling someone how to do something without telling them to actually do it (just instructions)

-- 

- Example: 



```r
server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
  output$summary &lt;- renderPrint({
    dataset &lt;- get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)
    summary(dataset)
  })
  
  output$table &lt;- renderTable({
    dataset &lt;- get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)
    dataset
  })
}
```

???

The left-hand side of the assignment operator (&lt;-), output$IDENTIFIER, indicates that you’re providing the recipe for the Shiny output with the matching ID. The right-hand side of the assignment specifies uses a specific render function to wrap a code block that you provide; in the example above, we use renderPrint and renderTable wrap our app-specific logic.

---

# Let's finish our example from earlier with college grad data


```r
  output$scatterplot &lt;- renderPlot({
    ggplot(data = college_recent_grads, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y)) +
      geom_point()+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
  })
}
```

---

# Summary to build shiny apps

Step 1: Create app from template 

Step 2: Add to the fluidPage()

Step 3: Use Input() functions to create inputs

Step 4: Use Output() functions to create outputs

Step 5: Use server to connect Input and outputs

---
# Run college_grad_app.R

--- 

# Your turn: Exercise 02

- create a new input for the user to select the line type to display (selectinput)
- inputid: line
- label = "Line Type",
- choices = c("dashed", "dotted")
- selected = "mpaa_rating")

- Use this to update the ggplot function in server.R

???

5 minutes 

---

# Solution: college_grad_app_02.R

---

#Your turn: Exercise 03

- use checkboxInput to show the data summary.

- create a new DT:rendertable item to show the underlying data 

- show the first 10 rows of the data in the summary using dataTableOutput

- update college_grad_app_02.R in the Exercises folder

???

5 minutes

---
# Reactivity

- Shiny uses a reactive framework

- supports reactive functionality

- When value of variable z changes, anything that relies on z is re-evaluated

- Regular R expressions would need to get updated with new values

---
# Reactivity
- input$plot_num is a reactive value


```r
output$myplot &lt;- renderPlot({
    plot(rnorm(input$plot_num))
})
```

- output$myplot depends on input$plot_num 

- All inputs are automatically reactive, so if you use any input inside a render* function, the output will re-render any time input changes

---

# Reactive Objects

- Three objects

--

- Reactive source: user input through browser interaction (reactiveValues()) 
Ex: "input$"

--

- Reactive endpoint: resulting plot or table that appears in the app (reactive())
Ex: the filtered datasets we will create
--

- Reactive conductor: connects sources and endpoints together (observe())
Ex: output
---

# Reactive Objects demo

--

- let's update the college grad data app to include the following:

--

- Include a dropdown filter on major category

--

- filter and save as reactive expression

-- 

- show the filtered data in the plot

-- 

- show the filtered data in the table

---

# Let's create the dropdown in the UI section


```r
  selectInput(inputId = "major_category", 
              label = "Major Category",
              choices = c(unique(college_recent_grads$major_category)),
              selected = "Engineering")
  ),
```

--- 

# Reactive Expression

- In server.r: 

```r
# library dbplyr
  major_subset&lt;-reactive({
    req(input$major_category)
    filter(college_recent_grads, major_category %in% input$major_category)
  })
```

---
# Use the new dataset in your plot and table

- Use major_subset() in place of your dataset

```r
 output$college_data &lt;- DT::renderDataTable(
    if(input$show_data){
      DT::datatable(data = major_subset(), 
                    options = list(pageLength = 10), 
                    rownames = FALSE)
    }
 )
```

---

# Your turn: Open college_grad_app_05.R and correct to make the title function work using reactive expressions

???

5 minutes


---

Solution: college_grad_app_06.R

---
# Reactives Summary

--

- **Reactive** variable means anything that depends on it gets re-executed automatically

--

- Use to reduce duplication

--

- Make it easier to handle complex calculations

---

# Reactive Context

- Reactive values can only be used in reactive contexts: 3 ways

--

- Any render* function is a reactive context

--

- Use reactive({...})  to assign a reactive variable

--

- Use observe({...})  to access a reactive variable


---

# This means you can't do this:

```r
server&lt;-function(input, output, session){
  print(input$x)
}

# Operation not allowed outside a reactive context
```

---
# Reactive : Implementation of reactive conductors

- Can access values or other reactive expressions

- can return a value

- useful for caching results (only updated when the value is changed)


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
	x &lt;- reactive({
input$num + 1
		 })
}
```

---

# Observe : Implementation of reactive endpoints

- can access reactive sources and reactive expressions

- **don't** return value

- used for side effects


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
	observe({
        print(input$num)
    })
}
```
---

# Walk through a demo of using observe

- Let's say we want to add an alert to our app to say "Hi user!"

---

# Adding Observe in the UI


```r
actionButton("button1","Directions")
```
---

Adding Observe to the server


```r
observe({
    input$button1
    showModal(modalDialog(
      title = "Directions",
      "You are looking at recent college grad data from the five thiry eight package in R"
    ))
})
```
---

Summary: Reactives vs. Observers

- Both contain expressions that can be executed

- Differences:

- reactive expressions return values but observers don't

- observers "eagerly" respond to reactives but reactive expressions don't 

- reactive expressions should not have side effects and observers are only useful for 
their side effects


---
  
# Your turn: Add your own observe button to show a pop up message 

# looking for volunteers to present their solution!
  

---

# Publishing your apps

- Go to http://www.shinyapps.io/ and make an account
- Make sure all your app files are in an isolated folder
- Click “Publish Application” in RStudio (you might need to follow instructions)

---

# Inlude shiny in your reports!

- Set output: html_document
- Set runtime: shiny
- You can now use interactive inputs/outputs in Rmarkdown!

---
# Other cool things as noted by Dean Attali 
- conditionalPanel - conditionally show UI elements
- global.R - objects here are available to both ui.R and server.R
- Use navbarPage() or tabsetPanel() for multiple tabs in UI
- Use DT::dataTableOutput() instead of tableOutput() for an interactive table instead of ugly static table
_ Add images by placing image under “www/image.png” and using UI function img(src = "image.png")
- Use update*Input() functions to update input values from R

---
