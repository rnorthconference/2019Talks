Oftentimes the data set you want to work isn't available in a workable format, it's in a table on a web page, in a database you can query or it's smattered throughout pages on a website.  There a few options for accessing data like this.

* Use the website API to access data
    + This is a pretty comprehensive list of [existing API's.](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)
    + Note, there may be API call limits so you may need to add Sys.sleep(1) calls to your code.
* Manually scrape the page you want
    + Read and parse html
      + Use the SelectorGadget Chrome add in for help getting the tags you want
          + Downside, not all web pages have html that is tagged well so you may need to dig in tag by tag if there aren't many class names associated to tags.
          + Tags may change result page to result page so you may need to use more general tag/class names than the selector gives you.
          + If you're just scraping one page it can be quick.
    + Read and parse json

### Glassdoor Search Companies by Location

* Browse to https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm, click on the companies tab. 
* Open developer tools and go to the network tab. Start typing in a location and see what happens.
    + Click one of the links that pops up and you can see the request URL generated for a search term.
    + Browse to that URL and you'll see the JSON list of possible results - We'll use these to create our links
    + Clear the network tab and submit your search. The URL you end up at doesn't look familiar but if you look in the network tab, scroll to the top of the list and you can see the request URL and click it.
          + Here you can see the request URL was actually very different.  If you scroll down to the bottom you'll see the request params, some of which should look familiar.  Location T and Location id were in the JSON we saw earlier.  
          + We now have the links need to generate a link to the result page based on the city we want to search.

library(rvest)

```


### Reading JSON For Company Location Id and Type


```{r}
# Get results links for location company search
location <- "Saint Paul"
location <- gsub(" ","+",location)
location_json <- paste0("https://www.glassdoor.com/findPopularLocationAjax.htm?term=",location,"&maxLocationsToReturn=10")

document <- jsonlite::fromJSON(location_json)

location_companies_url <- paste0("https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/company-reviews.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&clickSource=searchBtn&typedKeyword=&sc.keyword=&locT=",document$locationType[1],"&locId=",document$locationId[1],"&jobType=")
```


```{r}
# Get results links for location company search
location <- "Saint Paul"
# Replace spaces with + for request URL
location <- gsub(" ","+",location)
location_json <- paste0("https://www.glassdoor.com/findPopularLocationAjax.htm?term=",location,"&maxLocationsToReturn=10")
# Read the JSON for the location link created above
document <- jsonlite::fromJSON(location_json)

# Build the link to the result page for the location selected
# Deafult to select the first result, as it's most likely the correct match.  
# If you're not sure you could loop through and pull results for all possible cities.
location_companies_url <- paste0("https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/company-reviews.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&clickSource=searchBtn&typedKeyword=&sc.keyword=&locT=",document$locationType[1],"&locId=",document$locationId[1],"&jobType=")
```

### Reading html

```{r}
#Read the first result page of companies for that city
#i.e. html that corresponds to https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/minneapolis-reviews-SRCH_IL.0,11_IM567.htm
location_results <- read_html(location_companies_url)

#get links to company result pages 2-10
next_page_url <- location_results %>%  
  html_nodes(".pagingControls.cell.middle") %>% 
  html_node("a") %>% 
  html_attr("href") %>% 
  toString()

next_page_url_string <- paste0("https://www.glassdoor.com",next_page_url)

#add the first result page to the list
result_pages <- tibble(location_companies_url)
colnames(result_pages) <- c("link")

for(k in 2:10) {
  
  link <- gsub("_IP2",paste0("_IP",k),next_page_url_string)
  
  result_pages <- result_pages %>% 
    bind_rows(tibble(link))
}
```


### Accessing html nodes, attributes and their values

* Reference any html node(s) by class name using "." followed by the class name. 
    + rvest::html_nodes(".class_name") - will get all nodes with that class name.  Make sure the name you selected is specific enough to the set of nodes you want.  Many nodes have multiple class names so you may pull back more or less nodes than you want if you're not specific enough/too specific. 
    + If you want to get a very specific tag use the tag name at the beginning followed by all the class names, using "." for spaces, i.e. "div.multiple.class.name"
    + You can also pull multiple tags using ".class_name_1,class_name_2,class_name_n".
    + rvest::html_node(".class_name") - returns the first node with that class name. 
    + If there are multiple child nodes you can also use :nth-child(number) to get a specific child node. i.e.  html_node(".class_name:nth-child(3)")
* Grab a specific attribute within a tag using the attribute name.
    + rvest::html_attr("attr_name")
* To grab the actual value of the tag use, rvest::html_text()

### Why did I choose a loop instead of nodesets?

```{r}
review_page <- read_html("https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Target-Reviews-E194.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=false&filter.employmentStatus=REGULAR&filter.employmentStatus=PART_TIME&filter.employmentStatus=UNKNOWN")
  
hreview_nodes <- review_page %>% 
  html_nodes(".hreview")

#Compare the lengths of the following result lists
experience_test <- hreview_nodes %>% 
  html_nodes("p.tightBot.mainText") %>% 
  html_text()
  
pros_test <- hreview_nodes %>% 
  html_nodes("p.pros.mainText.truncateThis.wrapToggleStr") %>% 
  html_text()

#Because not every value will always be filled in, with a loop you can track which blanks match which review.

```


### Multiple results pages
Without logging in you can only access one page of reviews.  If you can log into the site with your request you can get the next set of results with the following URL to start.  
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Target-Reviews-E194_P2.htm


### Slide setup :)

```{r}
html_node() #Pull the first node that meets the critera
html_nodes() #Pull the entire nodeset that meets the criteria

Sample Html:
<tag_name class="class_name"> ... </tag_name>
<tag_name class="class_name2"> ... </tag_name>
<tag_name2 class="class_name3"> ... </tag_name2>
<tag_name2 class="class name four"> ... </tag_name2>
  
html_nodes(".class_name") --> <tag_name class="class_name"> ... </tag_name>
  
html_nodes("tag_name") --> <tag_name class="class_name"> ... </tag_name>
                           <tag_name class="class_name2"> ... </tag_name>
  
html_nodes("tag_name.class_name") --> <tag_name class="class_name"> ... </tag_name>
  
html_nodes("tag_name.class_name,tag_name.class_name2,tag_name2.class_name3") --> <tag_name class="class_name"> ... </tag_name>
                                                                                 <tag_name class="class_name2"> ... </tag_name>
                                                                                 <tag_name2 class="class_name3"> ... </tag_name2>
  
html_nodes(".class.name.four") --> <tag_name2 class="class name four"> ... </tag_name2>
  
html_nodes("tag_name:nth-child(2)") --> <tag_name class="class_name2"> ... </tag_name>

  
```
